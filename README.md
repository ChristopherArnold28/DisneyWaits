# DisneyWaits

## Overview
This repository is my attempt at generating a machine learning algorithm
to predict Disney Wait times. This is already being done by a number of
websites and is done relatively successfully. My difference is to hopefully
implement some live weather updating some of the other sites do not
necessarily take advantage of as well as a few other features that may be
overlooked.

## Repository Structure

* SQL:
  This holds all `SQL` necessary to regenerate my database
* SRC:
  This holds the `python` necessary to populate the database and perform analysis
  on the data that has been gathered
