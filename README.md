# DisneyWaits

## Overview
This repository is my attempt at generating a machine learning algorithm
to predict Disney Wait times. This is already being done by a number of
websites and is done relatively successfully. My difference is to hopefully
implement some live weather updating some of the other sites do not
necessarily take advantage of.

## Repository Structure

* SQL
  This holds all sql necessary to regenerate my database
* SRC
  This holds the python necessary to populate the database and perform analysis
  on the data that has been gathered
